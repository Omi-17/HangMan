# HangMan
The Repository contains the project details of Web Game HangMan.

You would be astounded to hear that our project is going to be a web game.The game is more or less an adaptation of Hangman, so is the name of our project. In this game, a phrase or a movie will be displayed on the screen with blanks.The player will be given fixed no. of guesses and he/she has to guess it by entering letters. The player may come across twists or challenges which he/she needs to hurdle pass to not loose turns and lose the game.  

The project was distributed amongst the team members with me responsible for developing and building the startup page asking the details of the user wishing to play the game. <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Omi-17/HangMan/blob/master/Hangman.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the page.
